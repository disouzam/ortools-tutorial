    "Charging of electric arc furnace (EAF) can be made using two or three buckets. To operate using two buckets it is necessary to use high density scraps that are also more expensive. Charging can also be made with three buckets, if low density scraps (low cost) were used. The advantage of two bucket charging is the lower energy consumption (circa of 10 kWh/t) due to smaller heat losses during removal of furnace lid and to the shorter tap-to-tap time, since each bucket takes around 5 minutes to be discharged into furnace.\n",
